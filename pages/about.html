					<h2>Project authors</h2>
					<p>
						This project was created as part of an academic exploration of <strong>at most k-out 
						polygons</strong> , combining theoritical analysis with a full interactive implementation.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Ethan Bebelambou</strong> - Implementation</li>
						<li><strong>Ziyad Haltout Rhouni</strong> - Theoritical analysis</li>

						<h3>Work distribution</h3>
						<p>
							The work on this project was divided between the theoritical foundation and 
							the development of the interactive enumerator:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Ethan Bebelambou</strong> implemented the enumeration algorithm, point-set editor, 
								polygon operations and all visualization components
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Ziyad Haltout Rhouni</strong> focused on the theoritical part of the project: understanding 
								the definitions, analyzing the enumeration algorithm, and verifying the geometric conditions such 
								as insertability, digability, and embeddability in the implementation.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

						<h3>Notes on implementation</h3>
						<p>
							The implementation presented on this webpage is faithful to the algorithm described in the paper,
							but with two important differences:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								We <strong>did not perform the preprocessing steps</strong> suggested in the original paper.
							</li>
							<li>
								One of the condition in the loops of the enumeration algorithm (<em>q ≺ p<sub>i</sub></em>)
								made it impossible to reach all at most k-out polygons in practice. After investigation, we
								removed that condition, and this resolved the issue.
								As a result, our implementation is <strong>slightly from the exact formal version</strong> 
								described in the paper, but produces the complete family of polygons as expected.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							These differences do not changes the conceptual nature of the algorithm, bu they modify the 
							enumeration behavior enough to be worth highlighting.
						</p>

						<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
						<p>
							We would like to thank the autors of the original paper for developing the concept and algorithm
							on which this project is based.
							<br>
							We also acknowledge the use of <strong>LLMs</strong> to assist in webpage layout, styling of the
							webpage and text structuring.
