					<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
					<p>To fully understand how the algorithm works, this section will shortly explain the primitives used.</p>
					<h3>Point Set</h3>
					<p>A point set S to put it simply is like a bag full of pairs of coordinates that represent the positions of the different points on a plane. 
						This set needs to abide by a rule though, and it's that it's assumed to have geneneral position, which simply means that no 3 points can be collinear.</p>

					<h3>Simple Polygon</h3>
					<p>A simple polygon is a polygon that does not intersect itself. In other words, the edges of the polygon can only meet at their endpoints, 
						and the polygon encloses a single continuous area with no holes.</p>


					<h3>Inside/Outside</h3>
					<p>This one is rather self explanatory. The points of the set S that are strictly inside of the borders of a given polygon are considered In(P)
						and for the points that are strictly outside of said borders, they are considered as you would guess, Out(P). It's good to note that vertices of 
						the given polygon P are neither in In(P) nor in Out(P). </p>
